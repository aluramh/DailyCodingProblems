# Dynamic Programming

## Notice any overlapping subproblems

## Decide what is the trivially smallest input

Simplest input where we do not need to even think about the answer. It makes sense.

## Think recursively to use memoization

## Think iteratively using tabulation

## Draw a strategy first

Recognize edge scenarios and visualize the problem. Helps exploring the problem and edge cases.
